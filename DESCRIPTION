Description: Convenient interface for applied regression models using RStan, 
  the R interface to the Stan C++ package. Models are specified with customary 
  R modeling syntax and can be estimated by performing full Bayesian inference, 
  apprixmate Bayesian inference (via variational approximation) or optimization
  of a (perhaps penalized) likelihood function.
