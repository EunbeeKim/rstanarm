rstanarm
========
This is an R package that emulates other R model-fitting functions but uses (R)Stan for the back-end estimation. 
The primary target audience is people who would be open to Bayesian inference if using Bayesian software were easy 
but would use frequentist software otherwise. That said, this R package often uses posterior medians as point estimates.
